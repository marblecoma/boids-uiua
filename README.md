# Boids in Uiua
Boids in Uiua using [Iris](https://github.com/Marcos-cat/iris)

This is a basic implementation of Craig Reynolds [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids). Parameters of the program, such as the screen size, number of boids, perception radius, and impact of forces can be configured at the top of the file. 

Holding down the left mouse button will cause the boids to chase the mouse position. 

## TODO

- Quadtree
- <s>Allow program to be reset via keyboard command</s>
- Allow dynamic control of strength of each force
