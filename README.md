# Boids in Uiua
Boids in Uiua using [Iris](https://github.com/Marcos-cat/iris)*

This is a basic implementation of Craig Reynolds [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids). Parameters of the program, such as the screen size, number of boids, perception radius, and impact of forces can be configured at the top of the file. 

## TODO

- Allow program to be reset via keyboard command?
- Sliders to dynamically control strength of each force?
